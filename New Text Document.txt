Got it! Here's a revised version with a bit more detail:

Excited to share a new project! While I usually leverage Spark for big data processing, I recently ventured into Python and Pandas to demonstrate my data engineering skills in a different context. This project showcases my ability to handle data cleaning tasks, including deduplication and outlier detection, using Python's Pandas library.

What sets this project apart is its focus on traditional ETL processes and data warehousing. I applied techniques learned from Hussein Nasser's "Fundamentals of Database Engineering" course to maintain metadata for optimal performance and data integrity in a PostgreSQL data warehouse.

This project not only highlights my versatility in using different tools and methodologies but also underscores my commitment to continuous learning and exploration in the field of data engineering.

Special thanks to Hussein Nasser for his invaluable guidance and insights throughout the course!
